        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",

        "### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

In this\\npaper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and\\ntask-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy\\nbetween the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update\\naction plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface\\nwith external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather\\nadditional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of\\nlanguage and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over\\nstate-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and\\ntrustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components.\\nConcretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever),\\nReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in\\nchain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and\\ngenerates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than\\nbaselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making\\nbenchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and\\nreinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34% and 10%\\nrespectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.\\nProject site with code: https://react-lm.github.io\\n\\nPublished: 2024-08-12\\nTitle: Towards Autonomous Agents: Adaptive-planning, Reasoning, and Acting in Language Models\\nAuthors: Yen-Che Hsiao, Abhishek Dutta\\nSummary: We propose a novel in-context learning algorithm for building autonomous\\ndecision-making language agents. The language agent continuously attempts to\\nsolve the same task by self-correcting each time the task fails. Our selected\\nlanguage agent demonstrates the ability to solve tasks in a text-based game\\nenvironment. Our results show that the gemma-2-9b-it language model, using our\\nproposed method, can successfully complete two of six tasks that failed in the\\nfirst attempt. This highlights the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing\\nthe problem-solving capabilities of a single language model through\\nself-correction, paving the way for more advanced autonomous agents.

However, there is still a lack of\\nability in existing CRS to (1) traverse multiple reasoning paths over\\nbackground knowledge to introduce relevant items and attributes, and (2)\\narrange selected entities appropriately under current system intents to control\\nresponse generation. To address these issues, we propose CR-Walker in this\\npaper, a model that performs tree-structured reasoning on a knowledge graph,\\nand generates informative dialog acts to guide language generation. The unique\\nscheme of tree-structured reasoning views the traversed entity at each hop as\\npart of dialog acts to facilitate language generation, which links how entities\\nare selected and expressed. Automatic and human evaluations show that CR-Walker\\ncan arrive at more accurate recommendation, and generate more informative and\\nengaging responses.', name='arxiv', tool_call_id='call_m51rEPicsh7qM05FSIBb6Mld')]\n",

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT.

However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA.

              "'RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. Here’s a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. This is typically done using a retrieval model like BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This means that the information from the retrieved documents is combined with the original query to provide more context and relevant information.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model (such as GPT-3, BERT, or T5) uses the augmented input to generate a response. The generative model can produce more accurate and contextually relevant answers because it has access to the additional information retrieved in the first step.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the input query is complex or requires specific knowledge that may not be fully captured by the generative model alone. By leveraging external information sources, RAG can produce more informed and accurate responses.'"

Here’s a breakdown of the components and how they work together:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval Component**:\\n   - This part of the system is responsible for retrieving relevant information from a large corpus of documents or a database. It uses techniques from information retrieval to find documents or passages that are most relevant to the input query.\\n   - The retrieval component can use various methods such as keyword matching, TF-IDF, BM25, or more advanced neural retrieval models like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR).\\n\\n2. **Generation Component**:\\n   - This part of the system is responsible for generating a coherent and contextually appropriate response based on the information retrieved by the retrieval component.\\n   - It typically uses a sequence-to-sequence model, such as a Transformer-based model (e.g., GPT-3, BERT), to generate text.\\n\\n3. **Integration**:\\n   - The retrieved documents or passages are fed into the generation model as additional context. The generation model then uses this context to produce a more informed and accurate response.\\n   - This integration allows the system to generate responses that are not only fluent and coherent but also grounded in factual information retrieved from the corpus.\\n\\n### Advantages of RAG Systems:\\n- **Improved Accuracy**: By grounding the generated responses in retrieved documents, RAG systems can provide more accurate and factually correct information.\\n- **Contextual Relevance**: The retrieval component ensures that the generated responses are relevant to the specific query or context.\\n- **Scalability**: RAG systems can handle large corpora of documents, making them suitable for applications like question answering, customer support, and more.\\n\\n### Applications:\\n- **Question Answering**: Providing detailed and accurate answers to user queries by retrieving relevant information and generating a coherent response.\\n- **Customer Support**: Assisting customer service agents by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and generating helpful responses.\\n- **Content Creation**: Aiding in the creation of articles, reports, or other content by retrieving relevant information and generating text based on it.\\n\\nIn summary, a Retrieval Augmented Generation system leverages the strengths of both retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to produce high-quality, relevant, and accurate responses.',\n",

              "   'output': 'LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique used in machine learning, particularly in the context of fine-tuning large pre-trained models. Here are some significant improvements and benefits that LoRA provides:\\n\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters required for fine-tuning. Instead of updating all the parameters of a large model, LoRA introduces a small number of additional parameters, making the process more efficient.\\n\\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: By reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated, LoRA also reduces the memory footprint during training. This is particularly beneficial when working with very large models that would otherwise require substantial computational resources.\\n\\n3. **Faster Training**: With fewer parameters to update, the training process can be faster. This allows for quicker iterations and experimentation, which is valuable in research and development settings.\\n\\n4. **Modularity**: LoRA allows for modular updates to the model. This means that different tasks can have their own low-rank adaptations, which can be combined or swapped out as needed. This modularity is useful for multi-task learning and transfer learning.\\n\\n5. **Maintaining Performance**: Despite the reduction in the number of trainable parameters, LoRA has been shown to maintain or even improve the performance of the fine-tuned model. This makes it an attractive option for adapting large models to specific tasks without sacrificing accuracy.\\n\\n6. **Scalability**: LoRA is particularly useful for scaling up to very large models, where traditional fine-tuning methods would be computationally prohibitive. It allows for the adaptation of models with billions of parameters in a feasible manner.\\n\\n7. **Flexibility**: LoRA can be applied to various types of neural network architectures, including transformers, making it a versatile tool in the machine learning toolkit.\\n\\nIf you need more detailed and specific information, I can look up recent research papers or articles on LoRA.
